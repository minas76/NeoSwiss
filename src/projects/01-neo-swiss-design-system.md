## Project Overview

This is a comprehensive, production-ready Neo-Swiss design system and portfolio built with modern web technologies. It demonstrates authentic Swiss design principles adapted for responsive, mobile-first digital environments.

### Design System Highlights

- **Responsive Grid**: 4 cols (mobile) → 6 (tablet) → 12 (desktop)
- **Fluid Typography**: Clamp-based scaling from 16px to 18px body text
- **Color Palette**: Monochrome foundation with single muted blue accent
- **Spacing Scale**: Golden ratio-based (xs, sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl, 3xl)
- **Components**: Buttons, cards, forms, navigation, footer

### Technology Stack

- **Eleventy 3.x** — Fast static site generator
- **Nunjucks** — Powerful templating engine
- **CSS Grid & Flexbox** — Modern layout techniques
- **Vanilla JavaScript** — Lightweight interactivity
- **GitHub Actions** — Automated CI/CD
- **Docker** — Containerized environments

### Key Features

✅ Mobile-first responsive design (4/6/12 columns)  
✅ Fluid typography with clamp()  
✅ Complete design system documentation  
✅ Blog system with markdown support  
✅ Project showcase with case studies  
✅ WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance  
✅ Scroll-based animations  
✅ Dark mode support  
✅ Lighthouse 95+ performance score  

### Design Principles

The system implements core Neo-Swiss principles:
1. **Grid-based structure** with responsive breakpoints
2. **Clear hierarchy** through typography and spacing
3. **Minimal decoration** — function over ornament
4. **Generous whitespace** for breathing room
5. **High contrast** for readability (WCAG AA+)
6. **Single accent color** for CTAs and highlights

### Accessibility

- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels and landmarks
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus-visible outlines
- 44px minimum touch targets
- High contrast text (7:1 ratio)

### Performance

- No JavaScript frameworks
- Optimized CSS (~15KB gzipped)
- Static HTML generation
- Image optimization
- CDN-ready
